# How to use

## While developing

```sh
gulp
```


This will start a dev server with hot reload and you can see your page at localhost:8080


## When publishing to hubspot

```sh
gulp build
```

This will compile all css + html into a single file at dist/index.html

Copy the contents of dist/index.html and create a page on hubspot and paste the content there.
